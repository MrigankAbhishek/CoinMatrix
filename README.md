# ðŸª™ CoinMatrix : Real-time Cryptocurrency Tracker
CoinMatrix is a dynamic and interactive cryptocurrency tracking application. It goes beyond a simple price tracker by integrating full user authentication to provide personalized features, including a custom watchlist dashboard and community sentiment voting.

The backend is built using a microservice-style architecture, with two independent Node.js servers: one dedicated to secure authentication and another for handling all public cryptocurrency data, which includes a smart caching layer to ensure high performance and low latency.
